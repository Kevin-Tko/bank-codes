A SWIFT code, or a Bank Identifier Code (BIC), is a unique identification code used to identify banks and financial institutions worldwide. SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, a cooperative organization that provides a secure network for financial institutions to exchange information and conduct transactions.
SWIFT codes are composed of either 8 or 11 alphanumeric characters and are used to facilitate international wire transfers. The code consists of four components: the bank code, the country code, the location code, and the branch code (optional). These components help identify the specific bank or branch involved in a transaction.
When sending money internationally, the sender must provide the recipient's SWIFT code and other necessary details, such as the recipient's account number and name. The SWIFT code ensures the funds are directed to the correct bank and branch, enabling secure and efficient cross-border transactions.
